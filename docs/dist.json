        "description": "This endpoint is labeled \"Account - General - Create\". It is a POST request, which typically is used for submitting data to be processed to a specified resource.\n\nThe URL for the request is http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/create877?locale=en-US987678. Notice there is a query string present at the end of URL. This contains the key \"locale\" with a value of \"en-US\", which suggests we're specifying US English as our preferred language for the response from the server.\n\nIn the headers, there is a single entry which is empty and disabled by default. Headers can often be used for sending additional information to the server such as client type, timestamps, action type information, etc.\n\nThe body of the request contains a JSON object with the following fields: \"email\", \"phone\", \"accountType\", \"password\", and \"zipcode\". Normally these fields are required when creating an account. It's important to note that the actual data (i.e. the actual email, phone, account type, password, and zipcode) must be replaced with valid information when making the POST request.\n\nFinally, there is also an \"auth\" field indicating that authentication is required for this endpoint. The type of authentication is a bearer token. The token value labeled as \"BearerToken\" should be replaced with the actual token string before making the request.\n\nIn conclusion, this endpoint is for creating a new account with specific account information. It requires authentication via a bearer token. The preferred locale is also specified in the query string. This is important information developers need to successfully interact with this endpoint.",

The actions performed by this endpoint are executed through a POST request.\n\nThe base URL for the request is \"http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/createnow?locale=en-US98767\". This specifies that the request will be sent to your localhost on port 3000, starting with the API endpoint at '/api/account/general/createnow'. The 'locale' is added as a query parameter at the end of the URL with the value of 'en-US'.\n\nInside the 'headers' array, there's an object with empty 'key' and 'value'. The 'type' is set to 'default', and it is 'disabled', which implies that this header does not hold any significant data, and is not required in the request.\n\nThe 'body' of the request is a JSON object containing five strings: 'email', 'phone', 'accountType', 'password', and 'zipcode'. These are key-value pairs required for the creation of a new account.\n\n- 'email': The email address of the user.\n- 'phone': The phone number of the user.\n- 'accountType': The type of the account to be created for the user. In this case, it is 'User'.\n- 'password': The password string for the new account. \n- 'zipcode': The zip code of the user's location.\n\nThe 'query' array contains objects that hold query parameters. Here, there is one query parameter 'locale' set to 'en-US', which could potentially affect the language or regional settings of the created account.\n\nThe 'auth' field is used for authentication purposes. It uses bearer token authentication which is indicated by the 'type' being set to 'bearer'. The 'bearer' array contains a 'key' value pair, where the 'key' is 'token', and the 'value' is 'BearerToken'. This is used for validating the client making the request.",

Both are required to successfully process a logout request.\n\nFor authentication, this endpoint uses the bearer authentication scheme. This simply sends the token with a 'Bearer ' prefix in the Authorization header.

A bearer token is a type of access token that is issued to the client.\n\n4. **bearer:** This is an array of objects that contains the bearer token for the request. Each object has a \"key\", \"value\", and \"type\". The \"key\" is the name given to the token, the \"value\" is the actual value of the token, and the \"type\" is the data type of the token.\n\n5. **method:** This is the HTTP method used for the request. In this case, it's a \"GET\" request, which means data is being retrieved from the server. \n\n6. **url:** This is the URL where the request will be sent. In our case, it's \"http://localhost:3000/api/account/keys/all/?sessionId=sessionId&accountId=accountId\". It includes query parameters for \"sessionId\" and \"accountId\", presumably used to identify the relevant session and account.\n\n7. **headers:** This is an array of objects, each representing a header that will be included in the request. Currently, the endpoint provides a default empty header which is disabled. Headers can include metadata about the request or other necessary information.\n\n8. **body:** This is the body of the request. For this endpoint, the \"body\" is set as \"raw\", but no data is needed or included as part of the request since it's a \"GET\" request.\n\nThis is a high-level overview of the endpoint data.

        "description": "This endpoint is named \"Account - Verify - Email Address\". It is designed to verify an email address linked to an account. \n\nIt uses the `POST` method, which allows it to send data to the server to create a new entry in the database. The `POST` method is often used when submitting filled forms.\n\nThe URL for this endpoint is `\"http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/email\"`. This endpoint lies within your local server running on port 3000. Its path is `/api/account/verify/email`, whereby it's within the 'api', 'account', 'verify', then finally, 'email' subdirectory.\n\nCurrently, it does not contain any custom `headers`. Headers are often used to provide information about the request body and the response, such as its MIME type, or to provide authentication information. If necessary, headers could be added accordingly.\n\nThe `body` of the request is being sent in `raw` mode. Raw mode is used when you want to send information without any encoding. This is useful when you want to send JSON or XML data to the server.\n\nThe raw data being sent consists of two key-value pairs:\n\n- `verificationToken`: The token used to verify the email. This would typically be a unique string that the server generates and sends to the email address for verification.\n- `email`: The email address to be verified. This must match the email address that the server has on record for the associated verification token.\n\nIn normal usage, both `verificationToken` and `email` would need to be replaced with actual data.",

It's typically used to send data to a server to create a new resource.\n\n**URL**: `http://localhost:3000/api/account/verify/phone`\nThis is the URL at which the API needs to be hit. Since we're in a local development environment, we're using `localhost`. The port we're using to access the local server is `3000`. The path of the API is `/api/account/verify/phone`, which is used to verify an account's phone number.\n\n**Headers**: []\nThis field is empty, meaning we're not sending any additional metadata in the header of this HTTP request. Headers often include items like authorization tokens, content type etc. However, none of that is required by this endpoint.\n\n**Body**:\nThe body of the HTTP request is sent in a `raw` format. This is the data that the API takes as input in order to verify a phone number.\n\n- `verificationCode`: This is the code that is used to verify a phone number. Typically, it's sent by an SMS to the phone number that needs to be verified. \n\n- `phone`: This is the phone number that needs to be verified. It needs to be provided so the API knows which phone number it's supposed to verify.\n\nThis endpoint requires both `verificationCode` and `phone` to be present in the raw JSON body of the HTTP request in order to work correctly.\n\nExample of the request body would be:\n```\n{\n  \"verificationCode\": \"123456\",\n  \"phone\": \"+1234567890\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the values with the actual verification code received and the phone number to be verified.",
