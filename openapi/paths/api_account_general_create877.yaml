  description: >-
    This endpoint is labeled "Account - General - Create". It is a POST request,
    which typically is used for submitting data to be processed to a specified
    resource.


    The URL for the request is
    http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/create877?locale=en-US987678.
    Notice there is a query string present at the end of URL. This contains the
    key "locale" with a value of "en-US", which suggests we're specifying US
    English as our preferred language for the response from the server.


    In the headers, there is a single entry which is empty and disabled by
    default. Headers can often be used for sending additional information to the
    server such as client type, timestamps, action type information, etc.


    The body of the request contains a JSON object with the following fields:
    "email", "phone", "accountType", "password", and "zipcode". Normally these
    fields are required when creating an account. It's important to note that
    the actual data (i.e. the actual email, phone, account type, password, and
    zipcode) must be replaced with valid information when making the POST
    request.


    Finally, there is also an "auth" field indicating that authentication is
    required for this endpoint. The type of authentication is a bearer token.
    The token value labeled as "BearerToken" should be replaced with the actual
    token string before making the request.


    In conclusion, this endpoint is for creating a new account with specific
    account information. It requires authentication via a bearer token. The
    preferred locale is also specified in the query string. This is important
    information developers need to successfully interact with this endpoint.
