  summary: Account - General - Session - Get Account Type
  description: >-
    The endpoint described is named `Account - General - Session - Get Account
    Type`. It's a GET type HTTP request that is made to the URL
    `http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/session`.


    This URL accepts three query parameters: `accountId`, `sessionId`, and
    `get`. 


    1. The `accountId` parameter is used to specify the unique identifier of the
    account for which the type is being requested.
       
    2. The `sessionId` parameter is being used to determine the valid session
    from which the request is made.
       
    3. The `get` parameter value is set to `accountType`, which indicates the
    type of information being requested from this API endpoint.


    For authentication, this endpoint requires a bearer token which is passed
    under the `auth` object. The `key` is set to `token` and its `value` needs
    to be replaced with the actual `BearerToken`.


    The headers part of the request is currently empty and disabeled, indicating
    that no additional metadata is being sent in the request header.


    The body of the request is also empty, which is consistent with a GET type
    request that normally does not contain a body but fetches data based on
    provided parameters in the URL.


    This endpoint basically provides a method for developers to retrieve the
    type of the account linked with the provided `accountId` during an active,
    authenticated `sessionId`.
