  summary: Account - General - Reset Password
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - General - Reset Password". It is designed
    to handle PUT requests for resetting a user's password in the account. 


    The URL where this request is sent to is:
    http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/reset. 


    This request does not use any specific headers (the provided header field is
    made blank by default and thus disabled). 


    In the body of the request, a JSON object is sent that includes values for
    the sessionId, email, and the new password. The respective values should
    replace the placeholders: "sessionId", "email", and "helloworld".


    The authentication required for this endpoint is of type `bearer`. The
    bearer token to authenticate the request is provided in the `auth` section,
    with the key named 'token' and value 'BearerToken'. The type of the bearer
    token is string. 


    In a nutshell, when this endpoint is hit with appropriate values in the
    request body and the bearer token, the password for the associated email
    account will be reset. This is a sensitive operation so the token is
    mandatory for giving access and validating the request.
