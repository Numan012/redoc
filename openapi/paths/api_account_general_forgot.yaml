  summary: Account - General - Forgot Phone
  description: >-
    This endpoint description is for the "Account - General - Forgot Phone"
    functionality. 


    The endpoint is expecting a `POST` request at the URL
    `http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/forgot`.


    In the request header, there's one key-value pair. The key `"Client-UUID"`
    which should have the value that identifies the client, usually a unique
    string provided by the server for each userâ€”"ClientUUID" in this given
    scenario.


    Request body requires a JSON formatted string containing the phone number
    that needs to be recovered. The key for this must be "phone" and its value
    will be the user's phone number.


    Authorization type is `Bearer` so you should supply a bearer token in the
    header for authorization, using the key "token" and corresponding token
    value as "BearerToken".


    This endpoint is generally used when a user forgets their connected phone
    number to the account and needs to bring up that information.
