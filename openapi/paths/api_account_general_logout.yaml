  summary: Account - General - Logout
  description: >-
    This endpoint is named "Account - General - Logout". It's used to log out an
    account from the service. It uses the POST method, meaning it's sending data
    to a specified resource, in this case, the logout URL.


    The URL of the endpoint is
    "http://localhost:3000/api/account/general/logout". "localhost:3000" is
    usually used for local development, so it might vary when deployed.


    In the headers section, it's currently empty with default type and it is
    disabled. Headers usually contain additional information for processing the
    request or response. In this case, none is needed.


    The body of the request contains the data JSON format which includes two
    properties: "sessionId" and "accountId". These are placeholders and need to
    be replaced with actual values when making a request. Typically, "sessionId"
    is to identify a user's current session, generated when a user logs in, and
    "accountId" is the unique identifier of the user's account. Both are
    required to successfully process a logout request.


    For authentication, this endpoint uses the bearer authentication scheme.
    This simply sends the token with a 'Bearer ' prefix in the Authorization
    header. The key is labeled "token" and the value is "sessionId", where
    "sessionId" corresponds to the current session's ID. This is most likely
    used to ensure only the authorized user can log out their account. 


    In summary, to use this endpoint to log out a user, you need to make a POST
    request to the provided URL, send the sessionId and accountId within the
    body of the request in JSON format, and send the sessionId as bearer token
    in the auth section.
